# Polycrystal Demos
Here are some jupyter notebooks illustrating how to use polycrystal modules.

**working_with_tensors.ipynb**
: *Working with Tensors*. This demonstrates the interface for  representing 3x3 matrices as vectors of components, as in the `Voigt` or `Mandel` systems.

**materials-database.ipynb**
: *Materials Database*. This demo shows how to create and load a YAML-based materials database. It uses the file `materials.yaml` as an example.

**stiffness-demo.ipynb**
: *Elastic SingleCrystal*. The elastic `SingleCrystal` class handles the elastic stiffness and compliance matrices. The demo shows the various systems for representation as a 6x6 matrix, the units, and application in different reference frames.
